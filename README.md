# Ray Tracing Diffuse Shading Animation

This project implements a simple ray tracing algorithm to render an animated video of a yellow sphere illuminated by a moving light source. The rendered frames are saved as PPM files and can be combined into a video using FFmpeg.

## Features

- Renders a yellow sphere with diffuse shading.
- Simulates a moving light source to create an animated effect.
- Generates frames in PPM format.
- Combines frames into a video using FFmpeg.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (g++ recommended)
- FFmpeg (for video creation)
